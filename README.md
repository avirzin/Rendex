# Rendex

**Rendex** is a simple Web3 simulation of an investment flow using a rebasing ERC-20 token. It mimics how users earn yield on invested funds, with returns based on a post-fixed rate tied to **CDI**, a Brazilian benchmark interest rate used in fixed-income financial products. The token balance grows daily through smart contract-controlled rebases, using an oracle-fed CDI value to simulate on-chain yield.

> ⚖️ **Regulatory Notice**  
> The modeled asset in this project behaves economically as an investment product and would likely be characterized as a **security** under Brazilian regulation.  
> In a real market implementation, a yield-bearing tokenized deposit would not function as a stablecoin, but rather as a financial investment whose return is tied to the performance of underlying assets.  
> As such, it would be subject to Brazilian taxes applicable to investments, including **Imposto de Renda (IR)** and **IOF**, depending on the final structure adopted.


# Investment Journey Overview

This section provides a simplified, high-level view of how an investment moves from fiat deposit to on-chain value creation and final redemption.
| &nbsp; | &nbsp;  |
|--------|-----------|
| <img src="./images/step01.png" alt="Depositing fiat" width="200px"> |**Depositing fiat** <br> The investor begins by depositing fiat currency into the platform. This deposit is held by the financial institution or on/off-ramp partner before entering the tokenization flow. |
| <img src="./images/step02.png" alt="Obtaining tokenized deposit" width="200px"> | **Obtaining tokenized deposit** <br> The fiat deposit is converted into a digital representation known as a tokenized deposit. This on-chain token reflects the investor’s claim to the underlying real-world funds. |
|<img src="./images/step03.png" alt="Investment pool" width="200px"> |**Investment pool** <br> The investor’s tokenized deposit is transferred into the investment pool smart contract. In exchange, the investor receives pool tokens representing their proportional share of the pool.|
|<img src="./images/step04.png" alt="Pool value increases" width="200px"> |**Pool value increases** <br> As the underlying assets generate yield, the pool’s unit price increases over time. The oracle feeds updated pricing and performance data to the smart contract, ensuring accurate valuation.|
|<img src="./images/step05.png" alt="Redeeming token" width="200px"> |**Redeeming token** <br> The investor converts their tokenized deposit back into fiat currency through the off-ramp partner. Finally, the funds are transferred back to the investor’s traditional bank account.|
---

> **Note:** In a real-world implementation, the investor would begin by depositing fiat, which is then converted into a tokenized deposit by a licensed financial institution.  
> This project does **not** cover the fiat-to-token conversion process and starts from the point where the ERC-20 tokenized deposit already exists on-chain.

## 🧱 Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- `RendexToken`: ERC-20 token with `rebase()` function and CDI oracle integration
- `CDIOracle`: Oracle contract for CDI rate data

### Off-Chain Components

- **CDI Oracle Service**: A Node.js service that fetches the current CDI from the [Brazilian Central Bank API](https://api.bcb.gov.br/dados/serie/bcdata.sgs.12/dados/ultimos/1?formato=json) and updates the on-chain oracle once per day. The monthly CDI rate is converted to a daily compound rate using the formula: `daily_rate = (1 + monthly_cdi)^(1/30) - 1`.
- **Rebaser**: A cronjob or script that calls `updateCDI()` and triggers `rebase()` daily to maintain the yield simulation.

---

## 🧪 MVP Features

- ✅ Connect wallet using MetaMask or WalletConnect
- ✅ View current token balance (auto-increasing via rebase)
- ✅ Admin-only button to trigger `rebase()`
- ✅ Display the current CDI rate from the on-chain oracle

```bash
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
CDI_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x... # Address of deployed CDI Oracle contract
```

2. **Start the oracle service**:
```bash
make up-oracle
```

3. **Monitor the service**:
```bash
make oracle-logs
```

For detailed oracle service documentation, see [oracle-service/README.md](oracle-service/README.md).

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run contract tests
npm run test

# Run frontend tests
npm run test:frontend
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia

# Verify contracts on Etherscan
npm run verify:sepolia
```

## 🔧 API Integration

The CDI rate is fetched from the Brazilian Central Bank API:

- **Latest Rate:** `https://api.bcb.gov.br/dados/serie/bcdata.sgs.12/dados/ultimos/1?formato=json`
- **Historical Data:** `https://api.bcb.gov.br/dados/serie/bcdata.sgs.12/dados?formato=json&dataInicial=DD/MM/AAAA&dataFinal=DD/MM/AAAA`

The monthly CDI rate is converted to daily compound rate: `daily_rate = (1 + monthly_cdi)^(1/30) - 1`

---

## 👨‍💼 Admin Functions

- `updateCDI(uint256 newRate)`: Update the CDI rate (admin only)
- `rebase()`: Trigger daily rebase (admin only)
- `setAdmin(address newAdmin)`: Transfer admin role (admin only)

# Rendex
Rendex is a simple Web3 simulation of an investment flow using a rebasing token. It mimics how users earn yield on invested funds, with returns based on a post-fixed rate tied to CDI â€” a Brazilian benchmark interest rate used in fixed-income products. The token balance grows daily, using an oracle-fed CDI value to simulate on-chain yield.
